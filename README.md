🌀 GitFiction: Rewrite Your Commit History, Just for Fun!

Ever wondered what your GitHub history would look like if it told a completely different story? GitFiction takes your real commits and reorders them into a humorous, dramatic, or nonsensical timeline.
🔮 How It Works

1️⃣ Enter your GitHub username
2️⃣ We fetch your commit history
3️⃣ We shuffle, reverse, or remix it into an alternate timeline
4️⃣ Get a fun, fictionalized version of your Git journey!

🎭 Example

Original history:

✅ Fix bug in auth module  
✅ Add feature X  
✅ Refactor database queries  
✅ Update README  

GitFiction version:

🔥 Big feature added!  
🤯 Wait… refactored everything??  
🐞 Oops, bug introduced in auth  
📖 Finally updating the README 🤦  

✨ Why Try This?

✔️ Just for laughs 😆
✔️ Share your "fake" journey on socials 📢
✔️ Discover how chaotic your commits can look
